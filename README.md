# DSI_demo

Putting the live coding files I made for the 2022 UF DSI symposium here, this is a super basic example of how to solve a real problem using a Streamlit app. The full ideal app is in integrity_example.py, the result of 15 minutes of live coding sits in the live_coding_file.py file. The link to the slides prior to this app can be found [here](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1lEd783k7HOfiR5cTjh1vqVeDIULGIYcgJEOKbQBmqR0/edit?usp=sharing)
